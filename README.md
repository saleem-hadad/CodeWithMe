# CodeWithMe
CodeWithMe is an online meeting (I host over Zoom) where software developers/engineers gather to learn and work together on software projects or features. In each session, we set a goal for what we want to achieve and collaborate to reach that goal by sharing knowledge, skills, and resources.
