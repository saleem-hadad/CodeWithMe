# CodeWithMe

## Goal

## What we learnt

- How to implement linear regression and ARIMA algorithms for forecasting spending in the [FINANCE](https://github.com/saleem-hadad/finance) applications
- How to split data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance
- The importance of selecting appropriate evaluation metrics, and potential pitfalls of relying solely on a single metric like Mean Squared Error

Overall, it was a great session and we made good progress towards improving the [FINANCE](https://github.com/saleem-hadad/finance) application.

## Code

```python
# Import the necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load the data into a pandas dataframe
df = pd.read_csv('finance.csv')

# Convert the year and month columns to a datetime object
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df[['year', 'month']].assign(DAY=1))

# Define the independent variable
X = df[['date']]
X['date'] = X['date'].astype(int) / 10**9 # Convert datetime to Unix timestamp
X = X.values.reshape(-1, 1)

# Define the dependent variable
y = df['amount']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create the linear regression model and fit it to the training data
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the testing data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the mean squared error of the predictions
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')

# Define a future date for prediction
future_year = 2022
future_month = 7
future_date = pd.to_datetime(f'{future_year}-{future_month}-01')
future_date_unix = future_date.timestamp()

# Make a prediction for the future date
prediction = model.predict([[future_date_unix]])

# Print the predicted amount for the future date
print(f'Predicted personal finance amount for {future_date.strftime("%B %Y")}: {prediction[0]}')
```
